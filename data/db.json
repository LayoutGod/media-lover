      "body": "Oncology is the branch of medicine dedicated to studying, diagnosing, treating, and preventing cancer. It focuses on understanding how cancer develops, grows, and spreads (metastasis). There are different types of oncologists: medical oncologists specialize in chemotherapy and immunotherapy, surgical oncologists perform tumor-removing surgeries, radiation oncologists use radiation therapy, pediatric oncologists treat childhood cancers, and hematologist-oncologists focus on blood cancers like leukemia. Diagnosis involves tools like biopsies, imaging tests (CT scans, MRIs), blood tests, and genetic testing. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. Oncology also emphasizes prevention through lifestyle changes, vaccinations (e.g., HPV), and regular screenings like mammograms. For advanced cases, palliative care helps manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Oncology is critical in reducing cancer's impact and advancing towards better treatments and potential cures.",
